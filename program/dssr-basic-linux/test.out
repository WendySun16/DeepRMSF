             Dissecting the Spatial Structure of RNA
              v2.2.1-2021jan12 by xiangjun@x3dna.org

As of version 2, DSSR may be LICENSED from Columbia University.
DSSR basic is FREE for academic uses, with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
DSSR Pro is available for paid academic or commercial users only,
and it is actively maintained and continuously improved.

This is DSSR *basic*. Advanced features are available in DSSR Pro.

****************************************************************************
Note: By default, each nucleotide is identified by chainId.name#. So a
      common case would be B.A1689, meaning adenosine #1689 on chain B.
      One-letter base names for modified nucleotides are put in lower
      case (e.g., 'c' for 5MC). For further information about the output
      notation, please refer to the DSSR User Manual.
    Questions and suggestions are *always* welcome on the 3DNA Forum.

List of 3 base stacks
  Note: a stack is an ordered list of nucleotides assembled together via
        base-stacking interactions, regardless of backbone connectivity.
        Stacking interactions within a stem are *not* included.

Summary of structural features of 8 nucleotides
  Note: the first five columns are: (1) serial number, (2) one-letter
    shorthand name, (3) dbn, (4) id string, (5) rmsd (~zero) of base
    ring atoms fitted against those in a standard base reference
    frame. The sixth (last) column contains a comma-separated list of
    features whose meanings are mostly self-explanatory, except for:
      turn: angle C1'(i-1)--C1'(i)--C1'(i+1) < 90 degrees
      break: no backbone linkage between O3'(i-1) and P(i)
